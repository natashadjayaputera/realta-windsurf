There are a few .windsurf configs in this repository:
- .generate-programs-from-sp.windsurf - for generating C# programs from stored procedures
- .net4-to-net6-conversion.windsurf - for converting .NET 4 projects to .NET 6
- .old-net4-to-net6-conversion.deprecated.windsurf - deprecated version of the above

To use these configs, rename the folder into `.windsurf` and read the Prompt file inside it.
