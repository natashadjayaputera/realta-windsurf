# UI Architecture Rules

- **Data Validation:** All validation logic MUST be in the ViewModel, not in Razor code-behind.
- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - **ViewModel:** Handles business logic, validation, and data state.
  - **Code-behind:** Handles UI events and component references only.
- **Component References:** Keep only UI components (`R_Grid`, `R_Conductor`, etc.) in code-behind.
- **Data State:** Business data must reside in ViewModel properties — never in Razor.cs fields.

## Violations
- ❌ Data validation in Razor.cs
- ❌ Storing DTOs in code-behind
- ❌ Using R_Button for navigation
- ❌ Hardcoded strings (must use Localizer)
- ❌ R_Conductor in inquiry pages
