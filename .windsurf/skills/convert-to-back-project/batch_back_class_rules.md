# CLASS RULES

## Implementation Rules
- `R_IBatchProcessAsync` must be implemented in each batch class in Back Project. See `batch_interface_implementation_pattern.md`
- Class must initialize `Logger` and `ActivitySource`
- Batch functions should be contained **only** in the batch class
- Do not include batch related process in interface (`I{ProgramName}`) and in controller

## Violations
- ❌ Adding batch functions to Common interfaces
- ❌ Exposing batch functions through Service layer
- ❌ Modifying stored procedure names or parameters
- ❌ Using streaming patterns for batch operations
- ❌ Implementing batch logic in main business class
- ❌ Missing Logger or ActivitySource initialization
- ❌ Adding batch related process in interface
- ❌ Adding batch related process in controller
