# ValidationAndBuild

## Overview
Agent purpose: validate project structure against the migration checklist, run build steps in the correct order, classify warnings/errors, and produce a standardized BUILD SUMMARY report. This agent is allowed to run terminal build commands when explicitly invoked.

## Instructions
- Execute pre-build validations (check csproj settings, DLL HintPath, structure).
- Run builds in specified orders and capture full output (`dotnet build {ProjectPath}`).
- Classify warnings into Code (CS####), External (NU####, MSB####), and Infrastructure categories.
- Attempt fixes for first failure, alternative approach for second, and escalate on third failure.
- Never apply code changes by commenting out code as a fix.

## Focus / Checklist
### Pre-Build
- Verify `.csproj` PropertyGroup settings match checklist (TargetFramework, LangVersion, Nullable, ImplicitUsings).
- Verify all R_* DLL references use `HintPath` (not PackageReference).
- Validate project structure against migration checklist matching `*MigrationChecklist*`.
- Verify no Logger/Activity in Common, no `R_FrontGlobalVar` in ViewModels, and no data state in Razor.cs.

### Build Execution
- Build order (backend): Common → Resources → Back → Service
- Build order (frontend): Common → Resources → Model → Front
- Execute `dotnet build` per project; capture stdout/stderr.

### Warning Classification & Handling
- Code Warnings (CS####): mark as FIXED/NEEDS FIXING.
- External Warnings (NU####, MSB####): document with reason and mitigation.
- Infrastructure Warnings: document acceptable reason if applicable.
- See @build_report_format.mdc to format outputs.

### Error Handling Flow
- 1st failure: attempt a safe fix (csproj setting, missing HintPath) and rebuild.
- 2nd failure: try alternative safe approach (restore, clean, re-validate paths).
- 3rd failure: stop and ask user with collected logs and suggested fixes.

## Context (files to reference)
- Automatically fetch all modular `.mdc` rules matching `*ValidationAndBuild*`.
- Automatically fetch all modular `.mdc` migration checklist matching `*MigrationChecklist*`.
- See @common_error_compilations.mdc for common error compilations.

## Outputs / Deliverables
- Per-project BUILD SUMMARY report (@build_report_format.mdc).
- Consolidated validation report for the solution.
- Optional fixes applied (if safe) with explanation in the report.
- Raw build logs (stdout/stderr) collected for each build step.

## Safety & Scope
- Terminal commands are allowed but **will only run when you explicitly ask** this agent to run builds (auto_run: false).
- All code changes proposed must be reviewed before applying.
- Never take destructive automated fixes without confirmation.

## Usage (Cursor)

* Type `/ValidationAndBuild` (custom commands)
* Copy: `validate and build `/net6/**/{ProgramName}*.csproj` following `*MigrationChecklist*`. Run builds and return BUILD SUMMARY reports for All projects. ProgramName: ...`
