# Access Level Patterns

- Controllers call **public** methods from `R_BusinessObjectAsync` base class:
  - `R_GetRecordAsync()`
  - `R_SaveAsync()`
  - `R_DeleteAsync()`

- **Protected override methods** (`R_DisplayAsync`, `R_SavingAsync`, `R_DeletingAsync`)  
  are **internal** to business logic classes — never called from controllers
