# R_SAVEBATCH USAGE PATTERN

`R_SaveBatch` is a method of the **R_Grid** component, not `R_ConductorGrid`.

✅ Correct:
```csharp
private async Task OnProcess()
{
    R_Exception loException = new R_Exception();
    try
    {
        await _gridUploadCurrencyRef.R_SaveBatch(); // R_Grid supports R_SaveBatch
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        loException.Add(ex);
    }
    loException.ThrowExceptionIfErrors();
}
````

❌ Wrong:

```csharp
await _conductorGridRef.R_SaveBatch(); // Compilation error — not supported
```

### Key Points

* Use only `R_Grid` reference for batch save ope\rations.
* `R_ConductorGrid` does not expose batch methods.
* Always wrap calls with `R_Exception` for proper error handling.
