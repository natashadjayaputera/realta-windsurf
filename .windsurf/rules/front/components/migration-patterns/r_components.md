# R_Components (NET4) → Not Used in NET6

## Purpose
- In NET4, `R_Components` was a prerequisite helper to host forms and enable `R_PredefinedDock` layouts.
- In NET6, `R_Components` is removed; `R_PredefinedDock` and related containers handle layout directly.

## Rules
- Do NOT port or recreate `R_Components` in NET6.
- Use `R_PredefinedDock` directly per `.razor` page.

## References
- `R_BlazorFrontEnd.Controls.R_PredefinedDock`
