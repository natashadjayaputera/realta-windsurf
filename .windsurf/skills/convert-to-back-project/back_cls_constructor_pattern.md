# Business Logic Class Constructor Pattern (NOT FOR BATCH OR REPORT RELATED)

```csharp
public class {ProgramName}Cls : R_BusinessObjectAsync<{ProgramName}DTO>
{
    private readonly {ProgramName}BackResources.Resources_Dummy_Class loRsp = new();
    private readonly Logger{ProgramName} _logger;
    private readonly ActivitySource _activitySource;

    public {ProgramName}Cls()
    {
        _logger = Logger{ProgramName}.R_GetInstanceLogger();
        _activitySource = {ProgramName}Activity.R_GetInstanceActivitySource();
    }
}
```

Rules:

* Always instantiate logger and activity source
* Resource objects (loRsp) per resource file used
* Base class must always be `R_BusinessObjectAsync<DTO>`
* NOT for Batch or Report
